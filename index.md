### More about Rosethorn
![Rosethorn Screenshot(1)](https://i.hep.gg/VjGNCVCn6)
- __Rosethorn is a Java developed chatbot that is designed to be fun, innovative, small and easy to use.__
- __She is something I have created based on a random idea I had at 3AM.__
- __Since she only has pre-programmed messages based on Keywords such as "Hi" and "How are you", I feel she is not as unique as I would like and I will most likely add to her in the future.__
